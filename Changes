Revision history for Classic::Perl

0.05    12 February, 2012
      • Fixed tests to work in 5.6 and 5.8 (Zefram)

0.04    25 September, 2011
      • Fixed a crashing bug that occurred with ||= in 5.9 and higher.
        In  5.9,  it required a constant on the right  to  cause  the
        crash. In 5.15.3 ||= would always crash.
      • Fixed the  changes  file;  I  somehow  got  one  from  a  dif-
        ferent branch in  the  0.03  release,  listing  changes  that
        never happened.

0.03    18 September, 2011
      • New $[ feature for 5.15+ (Thanks to Zefram for the patch!)

0.02a   17 October, 2010
        Make a test more resilient when certain OSes scramble line
        numbers in string evals.

0.02    10 October, 2010
      • $* in perl 5.9 and higher
      • use Classic::::Perl 5.008 import syntax
      • Fixed to work with perls built with -DDEBUGGING.

0.01    23 May, 2010
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world. It provides
        split  to  @_  in void  and  scalar  context  for  perl  5.12
        and higher.
