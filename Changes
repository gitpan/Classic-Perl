Revision history for Classic::Perl

0.03    27 March, 2011
      • Feature names are now in :foo format.  (The old  'split'  and
       '$*' names are still supported.)
      • New :version feature,  which makes ->VERSION calls within the
        lexical scope behave more like 5.8.x (bugs aside)
      • New VERSION export, which behaves like 5.8.x’s UNIVERSAL::VER-
        SION

0.02a   17 October, 2010
        Make a test more resilient when certain OSes scramble line
        numbers in string evals.

0.01    23 May, 2010
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world. It provides
