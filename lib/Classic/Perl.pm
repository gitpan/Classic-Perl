=head1 NAME

Classic::Perl - Selectively reinstate deleted Perl features

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.04

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Classic::Perl;
  # or
  use Classic::Perl 'split';

  split //, "smat";
  print join " ", @_; # prints "s m a t"

  no Classic::Perl;
  @_ = ();
  split //, "smat";
  print join " ", @_;
    # prints "s m a t" in perl 5.10.x; nothing in 5.12

  use Classic::Perl '$[';
  $[ = 1;
  print qw(a b c d)[2]; # prints "b"

  use Classic::Perl '$*';
  $* = 1;
  print "yes\n" if "foo\nbar" =~ /^bar/; # prints yes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Classic::Perl restores some Perl features that have been deleted in the
latest versions. By 'classic' we mean as of perl 5.8.x.

The whole idea is that you can put C<use Classic::Perl> at the top of an
old script or module (or a new one, if you like the features that are out
of vogue) and have it continue to work.

In versions of perl prior to 5.10, this module simply does nothing.

=head1 ENABLING FEATURES

To enable all features, simply use C<use Classic::Perl;>. To disable
whatever Classic::Perl enabled, write C<no Classic::Perl;>. These are
lexically-scoped, so:

  {
     use Classic::Perl;
     # ... features on here ...
  }
  # ... features off here ...

To enable or disable a specific set of features, pass them as arguments to
C<use> or C<no>:

  use Classic::Perl qw< $[ split $* >;

To enable features that still existed in a given version of perl, put
I<four> colons in your C<use> statement, followed by the perl version. Only
plain numbers (C<5.008>) are currently supported. Don't use v-strings
(C<v5.8.0>).

  use Classic::::Perl 5.016; # does nothing (yet)
  use Classic::::Perl 5.014; # enables $[, but not split or $*
  use Classic::::Perl 5.010; # enables $[ and split, but not $*
  use Classic::::Perl 5.008; # enables everything

This is not guaranteed to do anything reasonable if used with C<no>.

=head1 THE FEATURES THEMSELVES

=over

=item $[

This feature provides the C<$[> variable, which, when set to an integer
other than zero, offsets indices into arrays and strings.  For example,
setting it to 1 (almost the only non-zero value actually used) means
that the first element in an array has index 1 rather than the usual 0.
The index offset is lexically scoped, as C<$[> was in Perl 5.0-5.14,
unlike its behaviour in Perl 1-4.

Some details of the index offsetting behaviour differ from C<$[>'s
historical behaviour.  See L<Array::Base> and L<String::Base>, which
provide the new semantics, for details.

This is due to be removed from perl in 5.15.

=item split

This features provides C<split> to C<@_> in void and scalar context.

This was removed from perl in 5.11.

=item $*

This feature provides the C<$*> variable, which, when set to an integer
other than zero, puts an implicit C</m> on every regular expression.

Unlike the C<$*> variable in perl 5.8 and earlier, this only works at
compile-time and is lexically
scoped (like C<$[> in 5.10-5.14). It only works with constant values.
C<$* = $val> does not work.

<$*> was removed in perl 5.9.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs you find via L<http://rt.cpan.org> or
L<bug-Classic-Perl@rt.cpan.org>.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Much of the structural code in the XS file was stolen from Vincent Pit's
C<autovivification> module and tweaked. The F<ptable.h> file was taken
straight from his module without modifications. (I have been subsequently
informed that he stole it from B::Hooks::OP::Check, which pilfered it from
autobox, which filched it from perl. :-)

Andrew Main (Zefram) added support for C<$[> in 5.16.

=head1 SINE QUIBUS NON

L<perl> 5 or higher

In Perl 5.16 and higher, L<Array::Base> and L<String::Base> are required.

L<any::feature> is an experimental module that backports new Perl features
to older versions.

The L<Modern::Perl> module enables various pragmata which are currently
popular.
