Classic::Perl, version 0.01

This  module  aims  to  reinstate  features  deleted  in  recent  ver-
sions of perl.

So far,  the only feature we have is split to  @_  in void and scalar
context. This feature was removed in perl 5.12. With this module, you
can have it back.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN  module  or
the cpan script:

    perl -MCPAN -e "install Classic::Perl"

    cpan Classic::Perl

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl 5 or higher.


DOCUMENTATION

After installing,  you can find documentation for these modules  with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc Classic::Perl

Or try using man (it’s faster, in my experience):

    man Classic::Perl
