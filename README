Classic::Perl, version 0.03

This reinstates features deleted in recent versions of perl.

The features we currently provide are:

• split to @_ in void and scalar context. This feature was removed in
  perl 5.11. With this module, you can have it back.

• $* - This was removed in perl 5.9.

• $[ - This was removed in perl 5.15.3.

INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN  module  or
the cpan script:

    perl -MCPAN -e "install Classic::Perl"

    cpan Classic::Perl

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl 5 or higher.

In Perl 5.15, it requires Array::Base and String::Base.


DOCUMENTATION

After installing,  you can find documentation for these modules  with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc Classic::Perl

Or try using man (it’s faster, in my experience):

    man Classic::Perl
